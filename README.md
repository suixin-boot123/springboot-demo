Observer Pattern
Applicability
1,when an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other. Encapsulating these aspects in separate objects lets you vary and reuse them independently
2,when a change to one object requires changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed
3,when an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are. In other words, you don't want these objects tightly coupled
